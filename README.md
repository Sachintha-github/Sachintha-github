ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Sachintha-github, an aspiring software enthusiast exploring the realms of technology.

Iâ€™m interested in the intersection of software development and innovative solutions, particularly in the areas of backend/frontend development, mobile app creation, and ensuring robust security and quality assurance.

Iâ€™m currently learning and expanding my skills in languages like C#, JavaScript, and Typescript, alongside exploring cloud platforms like Azure and database systems such as SQL Server.

Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects that challenge and inspire growth, fostering a dynamic environment where creativity and problem-solving thrive.
